These had been seperated prior\n** Column names were added and modified for readibility.  See original dataset features_info.txt for column descriptions\n** final dataset was made \"Tall and Skinny\" using the melt function with subject and exercise as keys\n** final tidy dataset was created using dcast() grouped by subject and exercise and taking the mean() of the data column\n** The tiny dataset was saved to \"tidy_data.csv\"\n",
